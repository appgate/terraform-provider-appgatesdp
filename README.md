# Appgate SDP Terraform Provider

This repository contains the official Terraform provider for [Appgate SDP](https://www.appgate.com/software-defined-perimeter), enabling you to manage your SDP infrastructure as code.

## üîß Purpose

Our goal is to provide first-class support for **the latest version of Appgate SDP**, with compatibility and maintenance extending to the **two most recent versions** as well.

### ‚úÖ Supported Versions

We actively maintain compatibility with the latest **three** SDP versions:

| Appgate SDP Version | API Version |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| 6.5 (latest)        | v22         |
| 6.4                 | v21         |
| 6.3                 | v20         |

> Earlier versions may still be available, but they are not guaranteed to receive further updates or support.
