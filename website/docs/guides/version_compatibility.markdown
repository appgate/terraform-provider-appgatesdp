## Version compatibility

The terraform provider tries to maintain full support for all [supported version](https://www.appgate.com/support/software-defined-perimeter-support). Depending on your appgate SDP appliance version, the configuration is different.
You need to specify the `client_version` if you are not running the latest supported version.

The `client_version` tries to maintain backwards compatibility 2 versions back all the time.
